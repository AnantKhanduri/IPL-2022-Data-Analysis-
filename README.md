# IPL-2022-Data-Analysis-
The aim is to use Python to perform data analysis on the IPL 2022 Group Stage matches and thus gain some useful insights.
The dataset used for this analysis has been acquired from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindas01/ipl-2022dataset).
The Python libraries Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to perform the analysis in Jupyter.
All the packages used in this environment can be accessed via the "requirements2.txt" and "environment.yml" files.
